# N-Queens
This repository contains a Java-based solution to the classic N-Queens problem. The N-Queens puzzle consists of placing N queens on an NxN chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. This implementation ensures that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.
